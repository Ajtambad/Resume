# Latex to PDF using Github Actions

A github actions based workflow that is triggered each time I push a LaTeX file to the repo, which is then compiled into a PDF and pushed into the repo. Worked on this with a goal of having one shareable link to my updated resumes at all times. 
Three workflows, each triggered based on the filename of my latex resume file pushed, converts it to PDF and pushes it back to the repository.

Resumes are as follows:
- Software Engineering (SDE) - [https://ajtambad.github.io/Resume/SDE.pdf](https://ajtambad.github.io/Resume/SDE.pdf)
- DevOps/SRE - [https://ajtambad.github.io/Resume/DevOps.pdf](https://ajtambad.github.io/Resume/DevOps.pdf)
